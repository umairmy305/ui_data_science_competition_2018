The code contains my implementation of a CNN with data augmentation which helped me achieve my best score of 98.86%.
Before executing the code, download the needed files and store them in the same directory as the 'py' file.
You may download the files from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/118YHjFZB1tTcYxDu3-_YJVMZ_8K24Hkt?usp=sharing
Run the .py file to execute the code (You may use Spyder or Jupyter Lab; I prefer Spyder).
Please make sure TensorFlow is installed (version 1.6 or higher)
It would help greatly if you have TensorFlow GPU installed and your machine has a GPU.
